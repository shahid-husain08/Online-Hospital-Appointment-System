                    <h3>Providing Exceptional Care Since 1998</h3>
                    <p>Founded by Dr. Robert Chen and a team of dedicated medical professionals, LifeLine Hospital began as a modest 50-bed facility with a vision to transform healthcare in our region.</p>
                    <p>Today, we stand as a 300-bed multi-specialty hospital, recognized for our state-of-the-art facilities and personalized approach to medicine.</p>
                    <p>Our journey has been guided by our core values of compassion, integrity, and excellence. Every year, we treat over 100,000 patients with the same level of care we would want for our own families.</p>
                    <p>In 2022, we were awarded the prestigious "Best Patient Care Hospital" in the state, a testament to our continuous efforts to raise the standard of healthcare.</p>
